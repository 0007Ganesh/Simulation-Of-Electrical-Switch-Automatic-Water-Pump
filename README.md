Analysis:
An automatic motor for a water tank works by using a sensor, typically a float switch or a digital sensor, to detect the water level in the tank. When the water level drops below a preset point, the sensor sends a signal to a control circuit or microcontroller, which then activates a relay to power on the motor. 
The motor pumps water into the tank until the sensor detects that the water level has reached a higher preset point, at which time the motor is switched off. This system prevents water wastage and motor damage from dry running .In daily life this is very useful project .
Benefits
Water conservation 
Energy conservation
Protection of motor


Ideat :
The programme will accept only two output 0 means off and 1 means off
Step 1 Start
Step 2 Read values of water level in the tank 
Step 3 If water level in the tank is less than 5 litre then it is ON either water level in the tank is greater than 495 then it is off
Step 4 End
